# Secret Santas
(A coding exercise)

## Restrictions when assigning the Secret Santas:
- You cannot be your own Secret Santa.
- You cannot be assigned the same Secret Santa that you got in the previous year.
- You cannot be your partnerâ€™s Secret Santa.

## Assumptions
### Running of the Secret Santa
- There will only be one event each year
- There will only be one group of participants each year
- Other information like the location of the gift exchange and maximum spend will be communicated to the participants outside of this exercise.

### Participants
- Each participant has a unique name
 and can be used to to identify themselves to their Santa.
- The number of participants may be different each year
- A participant may not be included in each yearly event
- It is valid to have a person who is not in a Santa list but all people referenced in the Santa list must be in the person list.

#### Number of participants
- There will be sufficient number for each person to have a valid Secret Santa allocated to them
- The number will be a reasonable size of typically about 20 participants. Though no maximum will be set it is assumed to be 50 or less participants.
- The number of participants will be at least 3 without partners.

### Partners
- A participant may only have one partner each year
- The partner may be different or the same in another year.

### Distribution of Santas list
- Each participant will have their own email address to receive the name of the recipient of their gift.

## Design Features
### File loading
- The participants details are loaded from a CSV file
- All participants in the file will be for the current year.

### Reloading a file
- Previously loaded participants will have their details updated.
- Overwritten participants details will not be kept.  
- Replaces the current participants and any current Santa selection.
- A participant who is no longer in the list will not be removed from the list of known persons.

### Views
- List of this year's participants.
- List Santa selections
- Previous years participants and Santa details.

### Actions
- Load input file
- Generate a random Santas for each participant
- Delete previous Santa lists older than current or previous year. This includes people who are no longer part of a saved Sanata list.

## Database Design

The Secret Santa event is an entity with many to many relationship to participants stored in the people table. Currently the Secret Santa has only one attribute - year. So just the people-secretsantas table has been created. Indexes have been created for each foreign key in the people-secretsantas table. (NB Rails model generate command requires --force-plural.)
The previous_santa_id field could be selected from previous year record but the data is static once a new year record has been created makes it more convenient to access.
The year field is assumed to contain clean data and contain a valid value for the current year and validated within the design model. Data cleaning will be done on the input data.
